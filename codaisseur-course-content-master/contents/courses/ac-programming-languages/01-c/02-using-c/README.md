# Using C

C was developed in the late sixties / early seventies last century and was used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It was commonly used after that to replace systems that had been written in [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) and provided capabilities of low level performance and memory access with the ability of creating structured programs.

> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)):
>
> C is a general purpose, imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded micro controllers to supercomputers.
