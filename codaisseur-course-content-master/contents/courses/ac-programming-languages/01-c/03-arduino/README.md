# Arduino

The [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an open-source electronics platform. It is a great way to do electronic prototyping. You can experiment and prototype your own IoT devices, create your own controllers, sensors, robotics etc. 

An Arduino controller is an embedded microcomputer that can read and write digital (and analog) signals. It typically has a microprocessor that runs at 8 or 16 MHz typically has around 32KB storage for your program an 2KB ram.

You will learn to program an Arduino in C.
