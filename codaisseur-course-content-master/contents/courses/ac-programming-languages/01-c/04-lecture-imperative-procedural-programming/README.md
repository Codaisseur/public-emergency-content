# Imperative and procedural programming

This lecture will cover topics about imperative and procedural programming in more detail.

## Imperative programming
An imperative programming language uses a sequence of statement to modify the state of the program. Each one is executed in turn (one could say sequential programming.) Basic and, C are common examples. But almost every non-declarative (and functional languages are mostly declarative languages) language can be used imperatively. A lot of SQL, like the SELECT statement can be considered declarative.
This look very much like the way your cpu would operate, sequentially, instruction by instruction.

## Procedural programming
Procedural programming is a way to structure your programs in a procedures (functions). You could say procedural programming you van apply to imperative languages. It has it's foundation in Structured Programming which has scientific foundations, in that programs must be written with provability in mind.

>From [wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/Paradigms):
>
>**Procedural** programming can be defined as a subtype of imperative programming as a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which *statements* are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions). Procedure calls are modular and are bound by scope. A procedural program is composed of one or more modules. Each module is composed of one or more subprograms. Modules may consist of procedures, functions, subroutines or methods, depending on the programming language. Procedural programs may possibly have multiple levels or scopes, with subprograms defined inside other subprograms. Each scope can contain names which cannot be seen in outer scopes.

> Procedural programming offers many benefits over simple sequential programming since procedural code:
>
>- is easier to read and more maintainable
>- is more flexible
>- facilitates the practice of good program design
>- allows modules to be used again in the form of code libraries.
